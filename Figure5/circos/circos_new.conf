# 1.4 LINKS AND RULES
#
# The first data track we will add are links. By using rules, which
# are expressions that are evaluated for every link, the formatting
# can be dynamically changed based on data values.
#
# I will also show you how to change the definition of colors, if you
# would like to assign different chromosome color scheme to your
# figure.

chromosomes_display_default = yes

# In the previous tutorial (1.3), I used chromosomes_colors to change
# the color of the ideograms. This approach works well when the only
# thing you want to do is change the color of the segments.
#
# Another way to achieve this is to actually redefine the colors which
# are used to color the ideograms. The benefit of doing this is that
# whenever you refer to the color (which you can use by using the name
# of the chromosome), you get the custom value.
#
# If you look in the human karyotype file linked to above, you'll see
# that each chromosome's color is chrN where N is the number of the
# chromosome. Thus, hs1 has color chr1, hs2 has color chr2, and so
# on. For convenience, a color can be referenced using 'chr' and 'hs'
# prefixes (chr1 and hs1 are the same color).
#
# Colors are redefined by overwriting color definitions, which are
# found in the <colors> block. This block is included below from the
# colors_fonts_patterns.conf file, which contains all the default
# definitions. To overwrite colors, use a "*" suffix and provide a new
# value, which can be a lookup to another color.

# Links are defined in <link> blocks enclosed in a <links> block. The
# links start at a radial position defined by 'radius' and have their
# control point (adjusts curvature) at the radial position defined by
# 'bezier_radius'. In this example, I use the segmental duplication
# data set, which connects regions of similar sequence (90%+
# similarity, at least 1kb in size).
